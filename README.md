geometric graphs based on a [Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram) and their correspondent persistent homology graph families
___

a slightly deformed (minmax scaled and rotated) otherwise common H-R diagram:

and its corresponding "H-R graph", which is a geometric graph based on the stars' magnitudes and luminosities, for a suitable distance threshold:

by varying this threshold we obtain graphs for different spatial resolutions (see [persistent homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_homology)), yielding the following gif:
