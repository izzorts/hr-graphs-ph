geometric graphs based on a [Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram) and their corresponding persistent homology graph families
___

an HR diagram (which is obtainable from [this](https://github.com/izzorts/hr-graphs-ph/blob/master/original%20code%20and%20data/simple_plot_9_python.py)):

by constructing a geometric graph using the original HR diagram, while still helding the points fixed, we obtain the following:

if we now let loose of the points coordinates and let adjacency between vertices guide the layout of the graph we obtain one of what we call its corresponding "HR graph", for a suitable distance threshold:

for different such thresholds:

and

and

finally, by varying this threshold we obtain a sequence of graphs for different spatial resolutions (see [persistent homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_homology)), yielding the following animation:
