geometric graphs based on a [Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram) and their corresponding persistent homology graph families
___

an H-R diagram (which is obtainable from [this](https://github.com/izzorts/hr-graphs-ph/blob/master/original%20code%20and%20data/simple_plot_9_python.py)):

a slightly deformed (minmax scaled and rotated), otherwise common H-R diagram, which is one of the outputs of `HR_graph.ipynb`:

and its corresponding "H-R graph", which is a geometric graph based on the stars' magnitudes and luminosities, for a suitable distance threshold:

by varying this threshold we obtain graphs for different spatial resolutions (see [persistent homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_homology)), yielding the following gif:
